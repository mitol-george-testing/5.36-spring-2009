  "course_description": "The course, which spans two thirds of a semester, provides students with a research-inspired laboratory experience that introduces standard biochemical techniques in the context of investigating a current and exciting research topic, acquired resistance to the cancer drug Gleevec. Techniques include protein expression, purification, and gel analysis, PCR, site-directed mutagenesis, kinase activity assays, and protein structure viewing.\n\nThis class is part of the new laboratory curriculum in the MIT Department of Chemistry. Undergraduate Research-Inspired Experimental Chemistry Alternatives ([URIECA](http://web.mit.edu/chemistry/www/academic/urieca.html)) introduces students to cutting edge research topics in a modular format.\n\n##### Acknowledgments\n\nDevelopment of this course was funded through an HHMI Professors grant to Professor Catherine L. Drennan.\n",
